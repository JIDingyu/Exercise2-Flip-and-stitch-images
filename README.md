# Description of exercise 2
In this exercise, I used the turtle library to draw some geometric patterns taken from ancient Chinese pottery. I flipped and stitched them together in code in an attempt to create different patterns. Eventually, I applied these patterns to the garment I modelled.
Pictures of the modelled garment are placed in the “Final outputs” file.
